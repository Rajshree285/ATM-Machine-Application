# ATM-Machine-Application
This is an ATM Machine Application where the registered user can view their account balance, withdraw, deposit or transfer money to another bank account.

The main aim of this project is to built such a banking system which facilitates the users to perform transactions at their own convinience. The users would'nt have to rush to the overcrowded banks instead they can make use of the contactless ATMs. The prime advantage of using this ATM is that you dont need a credit/debit card to perform any transaction, all you need to know is your unique account ID and your PIN.

Steps to run the project:
1. Download and save the code files in a single folder.
2. Use command promt or any IDE (eclipse or any other) to run the code.
